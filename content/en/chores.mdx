# Chores & Stars

Turn household tasks into a fun game with stars and rewards.

## How It Works

1. Parents create chores with star values
2. Kids complete chores and earn stars
3. Stars can be redeemed for rewards in the reward store

## Creating Chores

Parents can create chores from the Chores page:

1. Go to **Chores** from the menu
2. Click the **+** button
3. Fill in the chore details:
   - **Name**: What the chore is (e.g., "Make bed")
   - **Stars**: How many stars it's worth
   - **Assigned to**: Which child (or all children)
   - **Frequency**: One-time, daily, weekly, etc.

## Completing Chores

When a child finishes a chore:

1. Open the app on any device
2. Find the chore in the list
3. Tap the checkmark to complete it

Stars are added to their balance immediately.

## Star Balance

Each child has a star balance showing how many stars they've earned. View balances on:

- The dashboard
- The reward chart
- The child's profile

## Star History

Parents can view the complete star history to see:

- When stars were earned
- Which chores were completed
- When stars were spent on rewards

## Tips for Success

- Start with a few simple chores
- Make star values fair and consistent
- Celebrate when kids earn rewards
- Adjust difficulty as kids grow
